#### Requirements:
⋅⋅* Install Ruby from website only for window and for mac it is builton [rubyinstaller.org](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) 
And download through commandPrompt by typing **_gem install sass_**.
finally sass is installed if not then try **_sudo gem install sass_**.

next step is setup a watcher in sass folder **_sass --watch main.sass:main.css_** its looks great for me
